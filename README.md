# transfer.py
Simple python client to upload files to the transfer.sh service

## What?
This is a simple client that just uploads or downloads a file to the [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) service. It was written as part of writing a client that encrypts files prior to upload and decrypts on download, so I could work out any kinks in the uploading/downloading process.
